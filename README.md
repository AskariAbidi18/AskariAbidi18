# Hi, I’m Askari 👋

B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) undergraduate with a strong focus on **machine learning, data-driven systems, and building things end-to-end** — not just notebooks.

I enjoy digging into how algorithms work internally, designing reusable architectures, and turning models into usable systems.

## 🧠 What I Work On
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Time Series Forecasting
- From-scratch ML implementations
- Data preprocessing & analysis pipelines
- APIs and system integration
- Graph algorithms & applied problem solving

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 BareMetalML
A **scikit-learn–style machine learning library built from scratch in Python**.

**What I did:**
- Designed a reusable `BaseModel` architecture
- Implemented custom scalers, encoders, regressors, and classifiers
- Focused on modularity and consistent APIs (fit / predict / evaluate)
- Emphasis on understanding ML internals rather than black-box usage

Tech: Python, NumPy

---

### 🔹 Electricity Consumption Forecasting
An end-to-end **time series forecasting system** for electricity usage.

**What I did:**
- Built forecasting pipelines using **XGBoost, ARIMA, and LSTM**
- Designed preprocessing for seasonality and external factors
- Exposed model predictions via API endpoints
- Currently optimizing convergence issues to improve accuracy

Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

---

### 🔹 Meteorite Anomaly Detection
Unsupervised anomaly detection on **NASA’s meteorite landing dataset**.

**What I did:**
- Applied Isolation Forest to detect rare meteorite events
- Engineered features using mass, composition, and geolocation
- Built a full preprocessing + visualization pipeline

Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

---

### 🔹 RecruitStripe (Placement Portal)
A **MERN stack campus placement platform**.

**What I did:**
- Designed student dashboards and recruiter panels
- Implemented application tracking logic
- Migrated static HTML/CSS frontend to React
- Integrated backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

Tech: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

---

### 🔹 Campus Navigation (AR/VR)
Graph-based navigation system for campus environments.

**What I did:**
- Implemented shortest-path navigation using **A\*** algorithm
- Modeled user constraints in graph traversal
- Planning AR integration using Unity + ARCore/ARKit

Tech: Python, Graph Algorithms, Unity (AR/VR)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C, Java, SQL  
**ML & Data:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch  
**Tools:** Git, Linux, REST APIs, Jupyter, MongoDB, Unity  
**Concepts:** ML, Deep Learning, Time Series, DSA, Graph Algorithms
